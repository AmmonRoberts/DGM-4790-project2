# Introduction
This is a Next.js app I built for my DGM4790 course at UVU. This app uses the MTG API found at https://magicthegathering.io/. 

# Features
- Searches for cards and returns a list of matches
  - Searches can be filtered by card name or card type
    - Searching by name is the default
- Cards can be saved to a shared collection
- Cards can be deleted from the collection
  - Only the "owner" of a card may delete it
- Profile page showing user's email address
